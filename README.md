# Smashing-Cocktails

A fun and easy way to search for cocktails you've wanted to try, or categorize a cocktail by ingredients you like.

## Motivation

I wanted a way to easily search for a list of cocktails according to which liquor I wanted to drink. Also, I would like someone to suggest to me a few cocktails I've never tried before. I'm often always making the same drinks and wanted a way to expand my palette with cocktails.
